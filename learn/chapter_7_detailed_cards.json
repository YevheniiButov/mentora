    "title": "Structure and Function of Oral Mucosa",
    "content": "The oral mucosa lines the oral cavity and is composed of stratified squamous epithelium and an underlying connective tissue called lamina propria. It serves as a protective barrier against mechanical forces, pathogens, and chemical irritants. The mucosa also contributes to immune defense, sensation, and fluid regulation. Different regions of the oral cavity exhibit variations in mucosal thickness, keratinization, and flexibility based on their functions."
  },
  {
    "title": "Types of Oral Mucosa",
    "content": "Oral mucosa is classified into three types: masticatory mucosa, lining mucosa, and specialized mucosa. Masticatory mucosa covers the hard palate and gingiva, is keratinized, and tightly bound to underlying bone. Lining mucosa covers the lips, cheeks, floor of the mouth, and soft palateâ€”generally non-keratinized and more elastic. Specialized mucosa is found on the dorsal surface of the tongue and contains taste buds."
  },
  {
    "title": "Gingiva and its Components",
    "content": "Gingiva is the part of the oral mucosa that surrounds the teeth and covers the alveolar processes. It is divided into free (marginal), attached, and interdental gingiva. Free gingiva forms the soft tissue wall of the gingival sulcus, while attached gingiva is tightly bound to the underlying bone. Interdental gingiva fills the space between adjacent teeth, forming the interdental papilla.",
    "reference": "See Fig. 5.1 on p. 75"
  },
  {
    "title": "Keratinization and Oral Health",
    "content": "Keratinized epithelium provides resistance to mechanical stress and is typically found in masticatory mucosa. Non-keratinized regions are more prone to injury and inflammation. Loss of keratinization, such as from chronic inflammation or trauma, can lead to mucosal compromise and sensitivity."
  },
  {
    "title": "Interproximal Spaces and Gingival Papilla",
    "content": "Interproximal spaces are triangular areas between adjacent teeth, usually filled by the gingival papilla. These spaces are bordered by the alveolar bone and the contacting tooth surfaces. Proper form and alignment of teeth are crucial for the health of the gingiva within these spaces.",
    "reference": "See Fig. 5.3 and 5.4 on p. 77"
  },
  {
    "title": "Gingival Line vs. Cervical Line",
    "content": "The gingival line represents the edge of the gingiva on the tooth, while the cervical line is the anatomical junction of enamel and cementum. These two lines usually follow a similar curvature but are not at the same level. Changes in gingival position, such as recession, affect the gingival line but not the cervical line."
  },
  {
    "title": "Embrasures and Their Function",
    "content": "Embrasures are spillway spaces formed by the contours of adjacent teeth near their contact points. They include incisal/occlusal, buccal/labial, and lingual embrasures. These spaces help in food dispersion during chewing and reduce impaction risks.",
    "reference": "See Fig. 5.8 and 5.10 on p. 79"
  },
  {
    "title": "Gingival Fiber Groups",
    "content": "Gingival connective tissue contains collagen fiber groups that support the gingiva and anchor it to the teeth. Key fibers include circular, dentogingival, dentoperiosteal, alveologingival, and transseptal fibers. These fibers help maintain gingival integrity and prevent tissue detachment.",
    "reference": "See Fig. 5.2 on p. 76"
  },
  {
    "title": "Alveolar Mucosa vs. Attached Gingiva",
    "content": "Attached gingiva is firmly bound to alveolar bone and is keratinized, while alveolar mucosa is more elastic and non-keratinized. The mucogingival junction marks the transition between these tissues. Clinically, this junction is important in periodontal assessment and surgical procedures."
  },
  {
    "title": "Role of Tooth Alignment in Gingival Health",
    "content": "Malaligned or crowded teeth can alter the gingival contour and increase the risk of plaque accumulation and gingivitis. Proper alignment supports a healthy gingival architecture and easier oral hygiene. Restorations must also respect gingival anatomy to avoid inflammation."
  },
  {
    "title": "Protective Role of Tooth Form",
    "content": "Tooth contours such as cervical ridges and marginal ridges play a role in protecting gingival tissues. They help deflect food away from gingiva during chewing and prevent trauma. Improper restoration contouring may cause food impaction and tissue injury."
  },
  {
    "title": "Periodontal Ligament Interface",
    "content": "The periodontal ligament connects the tooth root to alveolar bone. It also serves as a cushion, absorbing occlusal forces and housing blood vessels and nerves. It plays a role in proprioception and in the support of gingival and alveolar tissues.",
    "reference": "See Fig. 5.2B on p. 76"
  },
  {
    "title": "Gingival Recession and Clinical Implications",
    "content": "Gingival recession is the apical migration of the gingival margin, exposing the root surface. It can result from trauma, periodontal disease, or anatomical factors. Recession increases sensitivity, caries risk, and esthetic concerns, often requiring intervention."
  },
  {
    "title": "Gingivitis and Periodontal Disease",
    "content": "Gingivitis is the inflammation of the gingiva often caused by plaque accumulation. If untreated, it may progress to periodontitis, involving attachment and bone loss. Early diagnosis and good oral hygiene are key to prevention and management."
  },
  {
    "title": "Clinical Considerations in Restorations",
    "content": "Restorations should maintain proper contact points, embrasures, and contours to preserve gingival health. Overcontouring can hinder self-cleansing, while undercontouring may trap food and irritate tissues. Attention to these principles supports long-term periodontal stability."
