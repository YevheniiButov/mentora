    "title": "Definition of Occlusion",
    "content": "Occlusion refers to the contact relationship between maxillary and mandibular teeth when they approach each other during function or rest. It is a dynamic relationship that includes static contact, functional movements, and neuro-muscular coordination. Proper occlusion is essential for efficient mastication, speech, esthetics, and the long-term health of the temporomandibular joints and periodontium. Dental occlusion is not only structural but also functional and adaptive. Deviations can result in dysfunction and pathology."

  {
    "title": "Ideal vs. Functional Occlusion",
    "content": "Ideal occlusion is a theoretical concept where teeth, bones, muscles, and joints are in perfect harmony. It includes correct alignment, arch form, and balanced function. Functional occlusion, on the other hand, refers to the occlusion present in a functioning patient, which may not meet ideal criteria but can still be stable and asymptomatic. Recognizing the difference is key to appropriate diagnosis and treatment."
  },
  {
    "title": "Centric Relation and Centric Occlusion",
    "content": "Centric relation is a jaw relationship defined by the position of the condyles in the glenoid fossa, independent of tooth contact. It serves as a reproducible reference position in restorative dentistry. Centric occlusion, or maximum intercuspation, is the position where the upper and lower teeth fit together most tightly. In many patients, these two positions do not coincide, and the discrepancy must be considered in clinical treatment planning."
  },
  {
    "title": "Lateral and Protrusive Movements",
    "content": "Lateral movements occur when the mandible moves side to side. During these excursions, the working side contacts may guide the movement while the non-working side ideally discludes. Protrusive movement occurs when the mandible moves forward, typically guided by the incisal edges of the anterior teeth. These movements are important in designing restorations and maintaining occlusal harmony."
  },
  {
    "title": "Working and Nonworking Contacts",
    "content": "In lateral mandibular movement, the side the jaw moves toward is the working side, while the opposite is the nonworking or balancing side. Ideally, only the working side teeth contact during movement. Nonworking side contacts, if present, are considered occlusal interferences and can cause muscle strain and joint issues."
  },
  {
    "title": "Canine and Incisal Guidance",
    "content": "Canine guidance occurs when only the canines contact during lateral movement, disengaging posterior teeth. Incisal guidance involves the anterior teeth guiding the mandible during protrusive movement. Both types of guidance protect posterior teeth from excessive lateral forces and help maintain occlusal stability."
  },
  {
    "title": "Group Function",
    "content": "Group function is an alternative to canine guidance where multiple teeth on the working side share the load during lateral movement. This type of occlusal scheme distributes occlusal forces and may be more suitable in cases where canine guidance is not feasible due to tooth loss or wear."
  },
  {
    "title": "Balanced Occlusion",
    "content": "Balanced occlusion involves simultaneous contacts on both working and nonworking sides during functional movements. It is primarily used in complete denture design to enhance prosthesis stability. In natural dentition, however, this approach is not commonly applied."
  },
  {
    "title": "Parafunctional Habits and Bruxism",
    "content": "Parafunctional habits such as bruxism (grinding) and clenching apply excessive forces on the dentition and supporting structures. These forces often occur outside normal functional activities and may result in tooth wear, fractures, muscle pain, and temporomandibular disorders. Night guards and stress management are common interventions."
  },
  {
    "title": "Muscle Coordination in Occlusion",
    "content": "Proper occlusion depends on harmonious coordination of the masticatory muscles. The masseter, temporalis, and medial and lateral pterygoids play key roles in jaw movement. Muscle dysfunction can result in pain, limited motion, or abnormal occlusal patterns. Understanding neuromuscular control is critical in occlusal therapy."
  },
  {
    "title": "Temporomandibular Joint Anatomy",
    "content": "The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a complex, bilateral synovial joint composed of the condyle, articular disc, and temporal bone. It permits both rotational and translational movements. The health and function of the TMJ are intimately connected with occlusion. Disorders may arise from occlusal interferences or parafunction."
  },
  {
    "title": "Occlusal Interferences",
    "content": "Occlusal interferences are undesirable tooth contacts that hinder smooth mandibular movement. They may occur in centric, working, nonworking, or protrusive positions. Such interferences can cause premature contact, tooth mobility, and TMJ discomfort. Careful occlusal adjustment may be necessary to eliminate them."
  },
  {
    "title": "Occlusal Equilibration",
    "content": "Occlusal equilibration involves reshaping tooth surfaces to eliminate interferences and improve contact harmony. It is a conservative, irreversible procedure that should only be performed when justified. A thorough diagnostic workup is essential before equilibration."
  },
  {
    "title": "Clinical Applications of Occlusion",
    "content": "Knowledge of occlusion is vital across dental disciplines including restorative dentistry, prosthodontics, orthodontics, and periodontics. It influences the design of restorations, orthodontic planning, splint therapy, and implant placement. A functional and stable occlusion enhances long-term treatment success."
  },
  {
    "title": "Summary of Occlusal Principles",
    "content": "Occlusion involves complex relationships between teeth, muscles, and joints. Ideal occlusion provides comfort, function, and stability. Functional occlusion is dynamic and adaptive. Understanding these concepts is essential for diagnosing occlusal problems and creating effective treatment plans."
