  text: `A Coffee's journey from a regional Ethiopian beverage to a global commodity represents one of history's most remarkable trade stories. Legend attributes the discovery of coffee to an Ethiopian goat herder named Kaldi in the 9th century, who noticed his goats becoming energetic after eating berries from a certain tree. From these humble origins, coffee spread throughout the Arabian Peninsula, where it became deeply integrated into Islamic culture. By the 15th century, coffee houses emerged in Mecca and Cairo, serving as important social and intellectual gathering places. The Ottoman Empire played a crucial role in coffee's early dissemination, with Istanbul's coffee houses becoming renowned centers of conversation and culture by the mid-16th century.

B European encounter with coffee began in earnest during the 17th century, initially met with suspicion and resistance. Some religious authorities condemned it as the "bitter invention of Satan," particularly because of its association with Islam. However, Pope Clement VIII famously tasted coffee in 1600 and gave it papal approval, declaring it too delicious to remain exclusively a Muslim drink. This endorsement accelerated coffee's acceptance across Catholic Europe. The first European coffee houses opened in Venice in 1645, followed rapidly by establishments in England, France, and Holland. These coffee houses evolved into vital institutions for business, politics, and intellectual discourse, earning the nickname "penny universities" because for the price of a penny, one could purchase coffee and engage in stimulating conversation. The London Stock Exchange and Lloyd's of London insurance company both originated in coffee houses.

C The colonial era transformed coffee from a luxury import into a mass-produced commodity through plantation systems in tropical colonies. The Dutch successfully cultivated coffee in Java by 1699, breaking the Arabian monopoly on coffee production. France introduced coffee cultivation to the Caribbean, while Portuguese colonizers established massive plantations in Brazil, which eventually became the world's largest coffee producer. This expansion came at tremendous human cost, relying heavily on enslaved African labor. The legacy of this colonial coffee economy persists today in the geographic distribution of coffee production, with most cultivation occurring in former colonies along the equatorial "coffee belt." Modern coffee trade continues to raise ethical questions about fair compensation for farmers and sustainable farming practices, though initiatives like Fair Trade certification attempt to address these historical inequities.`,

          explanation: 'Perfect synthesis. Paragraph A establishes regional origins (Ethiopia, Yemen) and Middle Eastern cultural integration. Paragraph B shows European introduction, initial religious controversy, and eventual acceptance leading to coffee houses becoming intellectual and business centers. Paragraph C describes global colonial expansion, transformation from luxury to commodity, and acknowledges the tremendous human cost of slavery. The author shows the complete geographic and economic transformation from local product to worldwide commodity while honestly acknowledging the complex social and ethical implications, including the dark history of exploitation and ongoing modern ethical questions.'

The main progression is geographic expansion (regional → European → global colonial) and the economic and social implications of this expansion, including the acknowledgment of human costs.
