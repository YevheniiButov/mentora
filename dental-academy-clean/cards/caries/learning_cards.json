    "question": "What is dental caries?",
    "answer": "Dental caries is a chronic, multifactorial disease driven by the interaction between dietary sugars, dental biofilm, and host factors. It leads to localized demineralization and destruction of enamel and dentin. Caries develops over time through repeated acid challenges that dissolve tooth structure, particularly when oral hygiene is insufficient and dietary sugar intake is frequent.",

    "question": "The ecological shift in the oral microbiota",
    "answer": "The oral microbiota consists of a balanced community of commensal and opportunistic microorganisms. When this balance is disturbed—typically due to frequent carbohydrate intake—the environment becomes more acidic, selecting for acidogenic and aciduric species like *Streptococcus mutans* and *Lactobacillus*. This shift increases caries risk, representing a dysbiosis of the microbial community.",

    "question": "How dental plaque becomes cariogenic",
    "answer": "Dental plaque is not inherently pathogenic. However, frequent exposure to fermentable carbohydrates fuels acid production by cariogenic bacteria, lowering the pH below critical levels. This transforms the plaque into a pathogenic biofilm capable of demineralizing hard dental tissues. The pH cycling model, such as the Stephan curve, illustrates these dynamic changes in oral pH after sugar consumption.",

    "answer": "Tooth mineral loss is initiated when plaque pH drops below ~5.5, resulting in enamel demineralization. However, this process is reversible. Saliva acts as a natural repair system, supplying calcium, phosphate, and buffering agents. When fluoride is present, it enhances the formation of fluorapatite, making the enamel more acid-resistant and promoting remineralization.",

    "answer": "Dentin has a lower mineral content and a higher organic matrix, making it more susceptible to acid attack. Its critical pH is ~6.2. Once caries reaches dentin, collagen degradation begins, and bacterial toxins can penetrate toward the pulp, triggering inflammation and pain. This progression also involves a host immune response.",
