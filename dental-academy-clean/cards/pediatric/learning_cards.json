    "question": "Describe the early embryological development of teeth.",
    "answer": "Tooth development begins at the 6th-7th week of intrauterine development from the primary dental lamina (oral epithelium). Interaction between ectodermal cells and mesenchyme forms the tooth germ. Ameloblasts (from the inner enamel epithelium) form enamel, while dental papilla cells form dentin and pulp. Main stages: bud, cap, bell, then calcification. Disturbances in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions can cause anomalies in tooth number, size, and position.",
