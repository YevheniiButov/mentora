      "question": "Importance of Saliva in Oral Health",
      "answer": "Saliva plays an essential role in maintaining oral cavity health. It lubricates tissues, aids swallowing, starts starch digestion (amylase), and provides antimicrobial defense. It protects teeth by buffering acids and supplying calcium/phosphate for remineralization. Saliva also aids wound healing and cleanses the mouth by washing away debris and bacteria. Insufficient saliva leads to increased caries risk, infections, and difficulties speaking and eating.",

      "answer": "Saliva is about 99% water, plus electrolytes (Na+, K+, Ca2+, HCO3-), enzymes (amylase, lipase), mucins, antimicrobial proteins (lysozyme, lactoferrin), and immunoglobulins (mainly IgA). This complex mix enables multiple functions: digestion, lubrication, antimicrobial protection, and buffering. Balanced composition is vital for oral and systemic health.

      "answer": "Reduced salivary flow (hypofunction) causes xerostomia (dry mouth), impacting health and quality of life. Patients experience difficulty speaking, chewing, swallowing, and wearing dentures. They have increased susceptibility to caries, periodontal disease, oral infections (candidiasis), and ulcers. Causes include systemic diseases (Sjögren's), medications (anticholinergics, antihypertensives), and head/neck radiation.
