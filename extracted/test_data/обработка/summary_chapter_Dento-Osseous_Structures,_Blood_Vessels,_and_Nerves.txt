The chapter discusses the anatomy of the pulp chambers and canals, focusing on the mandibular first molar. The pulp cavity generally mirrors the tooth's outline unless multiple canals are present. The mandibular first molar typically has a large pulp chamber, with the mesial root often containing two canals and the distal root usually one, although variations exist, such as a fourth canal. The pulp horns are prominent, and the mesial canals may exhibit significant curvature, sometimes joining in the apical region. The distal root's canal is usually larger and may taper gently or constrict abruptly near the apex.
