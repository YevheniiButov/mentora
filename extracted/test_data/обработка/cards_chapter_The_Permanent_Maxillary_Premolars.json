      "question": "What are the main characteristics of the maxillary first premolar from the buccal aspect?",
      "answer": "The crown is roughly trapezoidal with little curvature at the cervical line. The mesial slope of the buccal cusp is longer and straighter than the distal slope, placing the cusp tip distal to the center line. The buccal surface is convex with a prominent buccal ridge.",
