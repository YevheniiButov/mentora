The chapter discusses the anatomy of the permanent maxillary molars, focusing on the first, second, and third molars. It explains that maxillary molars typically have three roots and a root trunk, with the lingual root being the longest. The first maxillary molar is characterized by a rhomboidal occlusal shape, with four major cusps and often a fifth cusp known as the cusp of Carabelli. The second molar is similar but has a smaller distolingual cusp and no fifth cusp, often resulting in a more heart-shaped occlusal outline. The third molar, or wisdom tooth, is highly variable in form, often smaller with fused roots, and can appear as a developmental anomaly. The chapter also highlights the functional and structural differences between these molars, emphasizing their role in mastication and the variations in their anatomical features.
