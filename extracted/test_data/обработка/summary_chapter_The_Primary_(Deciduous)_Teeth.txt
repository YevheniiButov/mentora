The chapter provides an overview of the development and eruption of primary teeth, emphasizing their importance in maintaining space for permanent teeth and their role in mastication. Primary teeth, numbering 20 in total, are smaller and whiter compared to permanent teeth, with more pronounced cervical ridges and roots that flare to accommodate developing permanent teeth. The chapter details the morphology of each primary tooth, noting that primary teeth have larger pulp chambers and higher pulp horns than permanent teeth. The primary maxillary central incisor is wider mesiodistally than cervicoincisally, while the maxillary lateral incisor and canine have distinct crown shapes and root structures. The mandibular central incisor has a flat labial surface and a long, tapered root, with a lingual surface that converges towards the root.
