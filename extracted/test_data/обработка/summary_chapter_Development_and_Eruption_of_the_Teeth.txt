Chapter 1 of the dental anatomy text introduces the division of tooth crowns and roots into thirds, which helps in understanding their structure and function. The crown is divided in three directions: incisocervically, mesiodistally, and labiolingually, while the root is divided into cervical, middle, and apical thirds. Line angles, formed by the junction of two surfaces, and point angles, formed by the junction of three surfaces, are crucial concepts for describing tooth morphology. The chapter also emphasizes the importance of learning tooth drawing and carving as a method to understand tooth form, with guidelines based on Dr. G. V. Black's average measurements for permanent teeth. Understanding these foundational concepts is essential for dental practice, as they aid in communication, diagnosis, and the restoration of tooth form.
