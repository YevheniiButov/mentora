      "question": "Describe the shape and significance of interproximal spaces.",
      "answer": "Interproximal spaces are triangular spaces between teeth, normally filled with gingival tissue. They allow for proper spacing of teeth and the accommodation of gingival tissue, which helps maintain oral health.",
