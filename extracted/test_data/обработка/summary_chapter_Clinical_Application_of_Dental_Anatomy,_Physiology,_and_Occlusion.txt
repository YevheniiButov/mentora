During lateral movements of the mandible, the occlusal cycle involves the mandibular molars coming into contact with the maxillary molars, sliding until centric occlusion is achieved. The chewing process primarily utilizes one side of the mouth, with the posterior teeth performing most of the work, aided by the canines. Protrusive occlusal relations involve the anterior teeth in shearing food, with the mandibular incisors contacting the maxillary incisors, and the canines assisting in the process. Neurobehavioral aspects of occlusion are crucial in understanding functions like chewing and swallowing, as well as parafunctions such as bruxism, which require intricate sensorimotor coordination. Occlusal stability depends on the balance of forces acting on the teeth, with disruptions potentially leading to shifts in tooth position and occlusion.
