The chapter provides an overview of the development and eruption of primary teeth, highlighting their distinct characteristics compared to permanent teeth. Primary teeth, numbering 20 in total, are smaller, have more prominent cervical ridges, and are lighter in color. They play a crucial role in maintaining space for permanent teeth and aiding in mastication. The pulp chambers in primary teeth are larger, and their roots are longer and more slender. The chapter also details the specific features of each primary tooth type, such as the maxillary central incisor and mandibular central incisor, emphasizing their unique anatomical structures and functions. Understanding these differences is vital for dental professionals in diagnosing and treating pediatric dental issues.
