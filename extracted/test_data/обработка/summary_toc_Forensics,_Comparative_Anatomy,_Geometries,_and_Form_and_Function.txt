Chapter 3 of the textbook focuses on the primary (deciduous) teeth, detailing their anatomical features and variations. The primary maxillary and mandibular canines and incisors are described with attention to their labial, mesial, and incisal aspects. The chapter highlights the structural differences between primary and permanent teeth, such as the tapering towards the cingulum and the distinct root bifurcation in molars. It also discusses the functional and dimensional differences between mandibular and maxillary canines, emphasizing the importance of these features in proper intercuspation during mastication. Additionally, the chapter outlines the unique characteristics of primary molars, such as the maxillary first molar's occlusal surface and root structure, which differ significantly from their permanent counterparts.
