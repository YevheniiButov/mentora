Chapter 3 of the textbook focuses on the primary (deciduous) teeth, detailing their anatomical features and differences from permanent teeth. The primary maxillary canines and mandibular central incisors are described, highlighting their labial, mesial, and incisal aspects. The chapter discusses the mandibular lateral incisor, which is similar to the central incisor but slightly larger, and the mandibular canine, which is compared to the maxillary canine, noting differences in size and root structure. The maxillary first molar is described as having a unique crown shape and root structure, acting as a transitional form between anterior teeth and molars. Finally, the chapter compares the maxillary and mandibular second molars, noting their resemblance to permanent molars but with distinct differences in size and cusp development.
