The chapter discusses the anatomy and function of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), highlighting its role in mastication and other functions such as speech and yawning. The TMJ is a ginglymoarthrodial joint, allowing for both gliding and hinge movements, and is composed of the mandibular fossa, articular eminence, and condyloid process, with an interarticular disk facilitating smooth movement. The joint is supported by a capsule and ligaments, including the temporomandibular, sphenomandibular, and stylomandibular ligaments, which provide stability during jaw movements. The chapter also covers the arterial and nerve supply to the jaws and teeth, primarily through branches of the maxillary artery and the trigeminal nerve, which are crucial for the function and health of the masticatory system. Understanding these structures is essential for diagnosing and treating disorders related to the TMJ and associated muscles.
