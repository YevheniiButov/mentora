    "question": "What are the primary differences between primary (deciduous) and permanent teeth?",
    "answer": "Primary teeth are generally smaller, have thinner enamel, and are more spaced out compared to permanent teeth. They also have a different root structure designed to allow for resorption during the transition to permanent teeth.",

    "question": "What is the significance of the cingulum in primary teeth?",
    "answer": "The cingulum is a raised, rounded area on the cervical third of the lingual surface of anterior teeth. In primary teeth, it provides structural support and is a key feature in the anatomy of incisors and canines.",

    "question": "Why are the roots of primary molars more flared compared to permanent molars?",
    "answer": "The roots of primary molars are more flared to accommodate the developing permanent teeth underneath them, which helps in their eventual exfoliation.",
