The chapter provides a detailed exploration of the anatomy of the permanent mandibular molars, focusing on the structural and morphological characteristics of the crown and root. The lingual outline of the crown is straight, with a pronounced curvature leading to the mesiolingual cusp. The mesial marginal ridge aligns with the mesial ridges of the mesiobuccal and mesiolingual cusps, and the cervical line displays an irregular, occlusal curve. The buccal outline of the mesial root is straight, with a gentle curve towards the apex, while the lingual outline is slanted buccally. The distal aspect of the crown is shorter, with surfaces converging distally, and the occlusal aspect is hexagonal, with a larger mesiodistal than buccolingual measurement. The mandibular first molar typically has five cusps, with the mesiobuccal cusp being the largest, and features a central fossa with developmental grooves and pits.
