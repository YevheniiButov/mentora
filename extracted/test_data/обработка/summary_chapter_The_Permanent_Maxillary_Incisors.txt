The chapter discusses the form and function of the orofacial complex, focusing on the design of contact areas, interproximal spaces, and embrasures in the dental arches. It highlights that these features vary with the form and alignment of the teeth, with specific sections of the arches showing consistent patterns. The chapter also emphasizes the role of canines in transitioning between anterior and posterior teeth, acting as a catalyst for maintaining constancy in tooth form adaptation. Additionally, it describes the importance of understanding the relative positions of contact areas and embrasure forms from different aspects, such as labial, buccal, and lingual views, to appreciate the functional dynamics of the teeth. Lastly, it touches on the physiological contours of tooth crowns and their significance in maintaining oral health, particularly in relation to periodontal attachment and gingival protection.
