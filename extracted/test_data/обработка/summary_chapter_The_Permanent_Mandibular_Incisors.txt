The chapter discusses the anatomy and characteristics of the permanent maxillary incisors, focusing on the central and lateral incisors. The maxillary central incisor has a crown with a more convex distal outline compared to the mesial, and the incisal outline is generally straight, becoming longer at the center. The root is typically cone-shaped with a blunt apex and is longer than the crown. The lingual aspect features a cingulum, marginal ridges, and a lingual fossa, while the mesial aspect shows a wedge-shaped crown with a significant cervical curvature. The maxillary lateral incisor is similar in form to the central incisor but smaller, with more curvature and variability, including possible developmental anomalies like peg-shaped laterals.
