The permanent maxillary premolars have distinct anatomical features that differentiate them from other teeth. The maxillary first premolar typically has two roots (buccal and lingual) and is characterized by a prominent mesial developmental depression on the crown and root, which is not present in the second premolar. The occlusal surface of the first premolar is hexagonal in shape, with sharp cusps and a well-defined central groove. In contrast, the maxillary second premolar usually has a single root and a more rounded crown with a shorter central groove and more supplemental grooves, giving it a wrinkled appearance. The lingual cusp of the second premolar is longer than that of the first, making the cusps more equal in height. Both premolars are crucial for effective occlusion and play a role in the transition between the anterior teeth and molars.
