The chapter discusses the anatomical features of permanent maxillary and mandibular canines, highlighting their structural differences and similarities. Maxillary canines are characterized by a prominent labial ridge, a conical root with a possible sharp curve, and a well-developed cingulum, while mandibular canines are noted for their narrower crown and less pronounced lingual features. The text also details the developmental timeline of these teeth, including calcification, enamel completion, eruption, and root completion. Additionally, the chapter provides measurement tables and compares the anatomical variations and common characteristics of these teeth, emphasizing their functional roles in the dental arch.
