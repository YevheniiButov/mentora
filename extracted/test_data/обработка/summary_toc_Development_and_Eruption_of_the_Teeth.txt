Chapter 1 introduces dental anatomy, focusing on the division of tooth surfaces into thirds and the formation of line and point angles. The crown and root of a tooth are divided into cervical, middle, and apical thirds, which are essential for understanding tooth morphology. Line angles are formed at the junction of two surfaces, such as the mesiolabial line angle on anterior teeth, while point angles are formed by the junction of three surfaces, such as the mesiobucco-occlusal point angle on posterior teeth. The chapter emphasizes the importance of learning dental terminology for effective communication in dental practice and highlights the need for familiarity with tooth morphology for clinical applications, including drawing and carving teeth based on standardized measurements. Understanding these concepts is crucial for diagnosing and managing dental conditions and for restorative dentistry.
