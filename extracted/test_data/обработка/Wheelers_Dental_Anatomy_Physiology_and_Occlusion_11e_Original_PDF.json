The first set of \nteeth to be seen in the mouth is the primary or deciduous denti-\ntion, which begins to form prenatally at approximately 14 weeks in \nutero and is completed postnatally at approximately 3 years of age. \nIn the absence of congenital disorders, dental disease, or trauma, \nthe first teeth in this dentition begin to appear in the oral cavity at \nthe mean age of 6 months, and the last emerge at a mean age of 28 \n± 4 months. The deciduous dentition remains intact (barring loss \nfrom dental caries or trauma) until the child is approximately 6 \nyears of age. At approximately that time, the first succedaneous or \npermanent teeth begin to emerge into the mouth. The emergence \nof these teeth begins the transition or mixed dentition period, \nin which there is a mixture of deciduous and succedaneous teeth \npresent. The transition period lasts from approximately 6 to 12 \nyears of age and ends when all the deciduous teeth have been shed. \nAt that time, the permanent dentition period begins. Thus the \ntransition from the primary dentition to the permanent dentition \nbegins with the emergence of the first permanent molars, shed-\nding of the deciduous incisors, and emergence of the permanent \nincisors. The mixed dentition period is often a difficult time for \nthe young child because of habits, missing teeth, teeth of different \ncolors and hues, crowding of the teeth, and malposed teeth.",

Most of the parts of the teeth that are hid-\nden by the gingiva can be visualized radiographically.

In addition, in pathologically deepened crevices, \ntooth surfaces can be sensed as far as the attachment of the periodon-\ntal ligament to the cementum. Perhaps the simplest example of clini-\ncal observation is the assignment of dental age or the assessment of \ndental development by looking into a child’s mouth to note the teeth \nthat have emerged through the gingiva.

Its primary function is to form the dentin of the \ntooth. When the tooth is newly erupted, the dental pulp is large; \nit becomes progressively smaller as the tooth is completed. The \npulp is relatively large in primary teeth as well as in young per-\nmanent teeth (see Fig. 3.9). The teeth of children and young peo-\nple are more sensitive than the teeth of older people to thermal \nchange and dental operative procedures (heat generation). The \nopening of the pulp cavity at the apex is constricted and is called \nthe apical foramen. The pulp keeps its tissue-forming function \n(e.g., to form secondary dentin), especially with the advance of \ndental caries toward the pulp. The pulp cavity becomes smaller \nand more constricted with age (see Fig. 13.3). The pulp chamber \nwithin the crown may become almost obliterated with a second-\nary deposit (e.g., osteodentin). This process is not as extensive in \ndeciduous teeth.",

A number of living and extinct spe-\ncies demonstrate a number of dental forms, from the bunodont \nto the selenodont (i.e., molars with crescent-shaped cusps) types. \nEach type is accompanied by an increased mobility of the man-\ndible in a lateral direction and increased anisognathism.

Lat-\neral movement increases in a number of animals to the extreme \nlateral excursions seen in the giraffe, camel, and ox. In relation to \nthe latter type of movement, it has been proposed that where the \ncondyle is greatly elongated transversely and very flat, great lateral \nmovement occurs during mastication, associated with selenodont \nmolars and a great degree of anisognathism.

The four canines \nare placed at the “corners” of the mouth; each one is the third tooth \nfrom the median line, right and left, in the maxilla and mandible. \nThey are commonly referred to as the cornerstones of the dental \narches.1 They are the longest teeth in the mouth; the crowns are usu-\nally as long as those of the maxillary central incisors, and the single \nroots are longer than those of any of the other teeth. The middle labial \nlobes have been highly developed incisally into strong, well-formed \ncusps. Crowns and roots are markedly convex on most surfaces.

The disk divides the articulat-\ning surfaces into upper and lower compartments that provide for \nsmooth gliding function.

The \nupper head of the lateral pterygoid muscle, which does not appear \nto be active during mandibular opening movement, stabilizes the \nrelationship of the disk to the eminence.

Because the mandible appears to rotate around a \ntransverse axis through the condyle in centric relation movement, \nguidance of the jaw by the clinician (see Fig. 16.42) in opening \nand closing movements that do not have translation is referred to \nas hinge axis movement (Fig. 15.13). In this position, the con-\ndyles are considered to be in the terminal hinge position. Under \nphysiological conditions of the masticatory system, centric rela-\ntion is used to transfer the position of the mandible (in relation to \nthe maxilla) to an articulator.",

During chewing, a \nlarge amount of proprioceptive (i.e., muscle sense) and exterocep-\ntive (i.e., tactile sense) information is fed to the central nervous \nsystem (e.g., cerebral cortex, brainstem, basal ganglia, spinal cord). \nRhythmic movements such as chewing are largely programmed \nor preprogrammed and involve learning, which reduces the need \nfor peripheral sensory input. However, inputs from muscle, joint, \ntendon, and periodontal receptors still have important functions, \nespecially in relation to learning, new experiences, and protective \nreflexes. Neuronal mechanisms must be present to provide for \nmodification of reflexes and continued updating of masticatory \nmovements by information about such factors as occlusal forces \nand the state and location of the bolus.",

Involvement of the \ntactile sense may range from picking up the food to grasping \nthe food with the incisor teeth. When the food is taken into the \nmouth, the lips, tongue, and periodontium function to estimate \nsize, hardness, and other characteristics that must be correlated \nwith previous behavior required for chewing. This information \nsets the chewing program in the pattern generator, including sub-\nsequences that relate to central and peripheral influences already \nin progress. Orofacial receptors such as periodontal mechanore-\nceptors may monitor occlusal forces and control the jaw-closing \nmuscles. The chewing program may be altered according to stages \nof chewing or in response to information from receptors in specific \nareas such as the palatal mucosa and tongue. The chewing rhythm \nmay be stopped because of noxious stimuli. Rhythmic and repeti-\ntive chewing behavior probably is disturbed by dysfunctional \nstates of the occlusion and/or the TMJs through which the bolus \nis shifted and the jaw moved to another position for the next force-\nful tooth–food  contact. Thus, chewing cycles may occur without \nthe development of an actual power stroke in dysfunctional states.",

Because brief definitions \nof occlusion are too limited to be useful as a basis for dental practice, \nmore complete explanations evolve into concepts or paradigms of \nocclusion that reflect prevailing interests and clinical convenience. \nThus, a modern concept of occlusion must include the idea of an \nintegrated system of functional units involving teeth, joints, and \nmuscles of the head and neck.

The sides of the arch that \nstarted with a distal step in the deciduous dentition proceeded to \ndevelop into a class II molar relationship in the permanent denti-\ntion. Of the sides with a flush terminal plane, 56% progressed \ninto a class I molar relationship and 44% into a class II molar \nrelationship. The mesial step in the deciduous dentition indicates \na greater probability for a class I molar relationship and a lesser \nprobability for a class III molar relationship. The class I molar \nrelationship is considered to be a “normal” relationship (i.e., the \nmesial buccal cusp of the maxillary molar occludes in the mesio-\nbuccal developmental groove of the first permanent molar) (see \nFig. 16.6A).

The distance \n(perimeter) around the dental arch, as measured from the mesial \nsurfaces of right and left maxillary second molars, is significantly \ngreater in uncrowded than crowded dentitions. Other researchers \nhave obtained similar findings. Orthodontists undertake the pre-\nvention or treatment of tooth and arch size discrepancies. How-\never, it is in the best interests of their patients for practitioners to \nknow about the significance of the differences in size between the \nprimary/deciduous teeth and the permanent teeth and between \ntooth size and arch size.",

In contrast, a mandibular first molar is \nalso delivered to the facial, with the forcep beaks engaging the furca \nbetween the mesial roots and the distal root from both the facial and \nlingual directions (Fig. 17.15). The movement to facial and lingual \nassists with the grasping and downward pressure to deliver the tooth \noccluso-facial or occluso-lingual. Thicker cortical plates require less \ndigital compression, but the operator’s supportive hand must resist \nthe pressure transmitted to the temporomandibular joint to avoid \ndistraction of the joint.13 Root elevators display narrow beaks to \nreach remaining small-diameter root pieces (Fig. 17.16).",

Broader, flat-bladed instruments help dis-\nsect tissue from underlying bone and release periodontal fibers. \nRoot elevators require an intimate fit of the tip of the blade with \nthe root form, while the gentle curvature of the back surface \ncompresses alveolar bone away from the root while severing peri-\nodontal fibers (Fig. 17.17). Use of a pushing force with gentle \nrotational movement assists in this process but also necessitates \noperator support as resistance similar to those used to recipro-\ncate forcep forces (Fig. 17.18). Occasionally, roots are sectioned \nin the furcal area using a handpiece to thin hard tissue, allowing \nengagement of internal undercuts with elevators to fracture apart \nroots. Delivery of posterior separated roots may vary because of \nanatomy. For instance, premolar and molar roots would align",

The occlusal contacting surface of the appliance \nis designed to promote stability over a broad range of mandibular \ncontact positions and is subject to the same principles of occlu-\nsal contact applied to single restorations—that is, provide a flat \nanatomical area distal to the occlusal contacts occurring in free \nunguided mandibular closure on maxillary appliances and mesial \nto the occlusal contacts, which occur during free unguided clo-\nsure on mandibular appliances. This is accomplished to provide \nocclusal stability between retruded mandibular positions and \nunguided occlusal contact positions to prevent the appliance from \noverly influencing mandibular position. Control of forces during \neccentric mandibular movements is conveniently done by adding \na gentle slope to the contour of the appliance, which results in a \nshallow cuspid rise or anterior guidance to separate the posterior \nteeth. For further study in the topic of occlusal adjustment and \nocclusal bite splint therapy, the student is directed to Ash44 and \nOkeson.46 (To view Videos 1–3, go to Expert Consult.)",
