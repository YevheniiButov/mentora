The chapter discusses the functional anatomy and movements of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), teeth, and masticatory muscles. It details the range of movements possible in the TMJ, including maximum opening, lateral, protrusive, and retrusive movements, and emphasizes the importance of understanding these movements in diagnosing TMJ dysfunction. The chapter also covers the complex coordination of masticatory muscles, highlighting the roles of specific muscles like the lateral pterygoid, masseter, and temporalis in jaw movements. Additionally, it touches on the significance of occlusal contacts and the concept of ideal occlusion, which involves specific contact points and relationships between the maxillary and mandibular teeth. Finally, it discusses the importance of understanding occlusal dynamics for effective dental practice, particularly in orthodontics and restorative dentistry.
