The permanent mandibular premolars, specifically the first and second premolars, exhibit distinct anatomical features crucial for dental identification and function. The mandibular first premolar is characterized by a prominent buccal cusp and a smaller lingual cusp, with a mesiolingual developmental groove that separates the mesiobuccal and lingual lobes. The crown tapers towards the lingual side, and the buccal surface is notably convex, making the buccal ridge prominent. The mandibular second premolar differs by having a more developed lingual cusp, often presenting in two forms: a three-cusp type with a Y-shaped occlusal pattern and a two-cusp type with a U or H-shaped pattern. Both premolars have roots that are generally single and taper towards a pointed apex, with the second premolar's root being larger and less likely to bifurcate.
