Chapter 4 discusses forensic dentistry, comparative dental anatomy, and the relationship between tooth form and function. Forensic protocols require obtaining admissible evidence like photographs and DNA from bitemarks. Comparative anatomy highlights differences and similarities in dentition across species, with humans having unique dental forms but sharing some characteristics with other vertebrates. Tooth forms evolve from simple to complex structures, such as haplodont, triconodont, tritubercular, and quadritubercular molars, reflecting their functional adaptations. The chapter also explores how tooth form influences jaw movements and occlusion, emphasizing the protective and functional roles of dental anatomy in mastication and overall oral health.
